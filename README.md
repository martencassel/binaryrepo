# About this project
## Motivation

Study various package managers and related protocols. For example, Docker Registry v2, Go Module registries, Helm registries etc.
Build a tool from scratch, simmiliar or identical to tools like Artifactory or Nexus (binary repository manager)
## Problem

Performance of package managers (docker, helm, or go and more) can be significantly improved by
resuing previously fetched resources from the internet to a local central shared cache server.

A shared cache stores responses to be reused by more than one user. For example, multiple users may need
to download the postgres:latest image from docker hub. By setting up a package cache server on the local network
it may serve many users so that popular docker images are reused a number of times, reducing
network traffic and latency.

This project tries to implement a binary artifact manager server that can serve software packages such as
Docker images, Helm charts or Go modules etc, either from a local storage or from remote sources (caching proxy).
All binary packages are stored in a "single-instance-store" using a checksum scheme.
## Current state

Binaryrepo is a server that serves a proxy cache for any docker registry that implements the Docker Registry v2 procotol.
In the current setup, public docker images can be pulled through it.

Due to limitations in the docker client, a reverse proxy (nginx) must be setup infront of the binaryrepo server,
in order to be able to pull images through the binaryrepo server from docker hub.
## Future plans

More features might be implemented.
## Getting started

The following example will setup binaryrepo to be used
as a remote proxy cache of docker hub.

Docker pull command will access the remote repo through a local nginx container.

## Prerequisites
1. Create certs
```bash
make setup-certs
ls ~/certs
```
2. Modify /etc/hosts
```bash
127.0.0.1 docker-remote.example.com
```
## Start everything and run docker pull tests
```bash
make check-remote-pull
```
## Building

```bash
make build
```
## Working demo
Proxy docker images from docker hub

- Create certs under $HOME/certs/ for nginx, add add the certs to your local cert store.
- Add docker-remote.example.com to your /etc/hosts file
- Start binaryrepo server at http://localhost:8081/
- Start nginx, it will proxies requests from docker-remote.example.com to http://localhost:8081/repo/docker-remote
- Run docker image pull on some sample images, remove the local images, and then pull again, now from the local cache in binaryrepo
  (tree /tmp/filestore)

```bash
make setup-certs
make check-remote-pull
```
