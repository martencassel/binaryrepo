The name and reference fields of the response body must match those specified in the URL. 
The reference field may be a “tag” or a “digest”.
The content type should match the type of the manifest being uploaded, as specified in manifest-v2-1.md and manifest-v2-2.md.

If there is a problem with pushing the manifest, a relevant 4xx response will be returned with a JSON error message. 
Please see the PUT Manifest section for details on possible error codes that may be returned.
If one or more layers are unknown to the registry, BLOB_UNKNOWN errors are returned. 
The detail field of the error response will have a digest field identifying the missing blob. 
An error is returned for each unknown blob. The response format is as follows:

{
	"errors:" [
	    {
            "code": <error code>,
            "message": "<error message>",
            "detail": ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
