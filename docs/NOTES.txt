Use case

    Remote proxy caching of docker registries (public or private) from multiple providers.


Design problems

    1. Unit testing an API client in golang.

    2. Who have implemented Docker Registry V2 api clients ?
        1. https://github.com/genuinetools/reg
        2. https://github.com/heroku/docker-registry-client

    3. Docker remote proxy

        Is a http handler that uses a Docker Registry V2 client
        to proxy requests to/from the upstream registry server to a local client that talks
        to the proxy server.

Docker Remote caching

    1. Must support Docker Registry v2
    2. Must only perform pull operations
    3. Must support all major Docker Registries in the cloud
    4. Must handle authentication
    5. Must be testable
    6. Must support various cli tools (docker-cli, img, buildx)
    7. Must support proxying private docker repos

* Pull-through cache of docker repositories
